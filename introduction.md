## About

The primary purpose of this website is to serve as a comprehensive resource for challenge lab teams aiming to build **Minimum Viable Products (MVPs)**. It is designed to guide teams through the essentials of software development, enabling them to leverage advanced technologies like:

- **LLM API Integration**: Integrating language models into applications for intelligent functionality.
- **ChatGPT for Code Generation**: Accelerating development with AI-assisted coding and debugging.
- **Key Development Topics**: Covering front-end design, back-end integration, deployment, scaling, and more.

This resource aims to empower non-technical teams with the foundational knowledge required to create scalable full-stack applications, even without prior software development experience.

## Usage

To make the most out of this resource, follow these steps:

1. **Explore the Guides**: Navigate through the step-by-step tutorials available in the different sections. These cover everything from tool setup to API integration and deployment strategies.
2. **Work on Exercises**: Use the exercises provided in Notion and Jupyter Notebook formats to reinforce your learning with hands-on practice.
3. **Apply What You Learn**: Experiment by building small-scale projects to test your understanding of full-stack application development.
4. **Refer to Examples**: Utilize example code snippets and solutions as references when working on your own MVP.

## Tips

To maximize your learning and productivity, keep the following tips in mind:

- **Start Small**: Begin with simpler guides and gradually integrate more advanced topics as you build confidence.
- **Understand First**: Add small changes to help you see how the program will respond to your input.
- **Use GPT Effectively**: Practice crafting precise and clear prompts when working with GPT for code generation or debugging.
- **Collaborate with Your Team**: Share tasks and resources with your team members to ensure everyone is aligned.
- **Experiment Fearlessly**: Donâ€™t hesitate to experiment with code and designs; mistakes are part of the learning process.

## How to Get Help

If you encounter any issues or need further clarification, here are some ways to seek help:

1. **Check the Documentation**: Look for solutions in the guides and FAQs provided on this site.
2. **Ask GPT**: Use ChatGPT for quick assistance with coding problems or technical questions.
3. **Join Discussions**: Engage with peers or mentors for advice on resolving challenges or brainstorming ideas.
