# Basics of Deployment

Deploying an application means making it available for users to access over the internet. It involves hosting your application on a server and ensuring it runs reliably.

## Types of Deployment

### 1. **Local Deployment**
- Hosting the application on a local machine or private server.
- Pros: Simple and cost-effective for small-scale use.
- Cons: Limited accessibility and scalability.

### 2. **Cloud Deployment**
- Hosting the application on a cloud platform like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.
- Pros: Highly accessible, scalable, and secure.
- Cons: Requires management of costs and cloud resources.

### 3. **Hybrid Deployment**
- Combines local and cloud deployment for optimized costs and performance.
- Example: Critical services are on the cloud, while backups are local at company servers.

## Key Steps in Deployment

### 1. **Prepare the Application**
- Ensure your application is production-ready. This means the application is feature-complete and free of bugs.
- Prepare files, optimize images, and remove debugging tools (as your users do not need to see this).

### 2. **Choose a Hosting Platform**
- Select a platform to host your application. Common choices include:
  - **Heroku:** Beginner-friendly and great for small projects.
  - **AWS EC2:** Offers high flexibility and scalability.
  - **Vercel/Netlify:** Excellent for front-end or static websites.

### 3. **Set Up the Environment**
- Configure environment variables, such as API keys and database credentials.
- Example: Use `.env` files to store sensitive information securely.

### 4. **Deploy the Application**
- Push your application to the hosting platform.

## Tools for Deployment

- **Docker:** Containerizes applications for consistent environments. This makes the application run 'independently' and will not be affected by the differences between external environments, such as OS, runtime variables, etc.
- **GitHub Actions:** Automates deployment processes, including building software, basic debugging, and deploying to the server.
- **Kubernetes:** Manages deployment and scaling in distributed systems, which will be discussed later.
